# Lattices of compatibly embedded finite fields in Nemo

Demonstrating the newly implemented lattices of compatibly embedded
finite fields in Nemo. Thanks to [@erou](https://github.com/erou/).

## Preview

Have a look at <demo.ipynb> to learn about the interface.

## Play around

Play around with the code [in the
cloud](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/erou/Nemo-embeddings-demo/master),
